Though I am a bit anxious about my first day, it feels so good to know that things eventually do work out. Needed to write this down today so I don't forget how I feel right now :D",

I did leave the party so that I could feel better and not as anxious anymore. It helped. Though, I know someday things will get better, so long as I keep trying.",

I remember just a year ago I was so anxious about going out and partying, being around other people, but that's totally changed now :D I think working on myself over the past year really helped with my anxiety. It made me realize that no one is really thinking about me that much and everyone is worried more about themselves and what they are trying to work on. Everybody's got something they are going through, and I was able to go through my fears :)",

When I was waiting in line, the person in front of me dropped their bag, so I helped them pick it up. I noticed a BrainStation button on the person's bag and asked them if they went there. It turns out that they do! Her name is Georgia and it looks like she's graduated just before I enrolled! Really nice to meet a new friend, we exchanged contacts and will keep in touch in the future.",
